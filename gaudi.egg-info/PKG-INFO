# GAuDI
**GAuDI** - Generalized Automatic Data Ingestion pipeline is a data pre-processing toolkit for the NCI project. With GAuDI you are able to swiftly construct personalized data preprocessing pipeline tailored to your needs.



Installation
==================
At this stage GAuDI can be installed via pip into your favorite conda from the wheel file in a shared location:

``pip install /mnt/nci/scratch/packages/gaudi-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl``

Documentation
============================
* [Documentation Link](file:////mnt/nci/scratch/gaudi/docs/build/html/index.html)

Tutorial and Example Scripts
============================

* [GAuDi Run Scripts Repo](https://ncigitlab01.repd.ornlkdi.org/nci/gaudi-run-scripts)
* [GAuDI GitLab](https://ncigitlab01.repd.ornlkdi.org/nci/gaudi)

Key Features
============
* **Efficiency** - with power of Polars and multithreading, GAuDI ensures rapid transformation of even large datasets.
* **Modularity** - designed with component-based architecture, users can integrate individual modules based on their specific needs. Each module (normalizer, pre-tokenizer, splitter etc.) operates as individual unit.
* **Extendibility** - GAuDI's design allows for seamless integration of new modules and methods.
